# C++ 程序：打印星号的金字塔图案

> 原文：<https://www.tutorialgateway.org/cpp-program-to-print-pyramid-star-pattern/>

写一个 C++ 程序，用 for 循环打印星号的金字塔图案。

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i, j, k, rows;

    cout << "Enter Pyramid Star Pattern Row = ";
    cin >> rows;

    cout << "Pyramid Star Pattern\n"; 

    for(i = 1; i <= rows; i++)
    {
    	for(j = 0; j <= rows - i; j++)
		{
            cout << " ";
        }
        for(k = 0; k < i * 2 - 1; k++)
        {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }		
 	return 0;
}
```

这个 [C++ 例子](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/cpp-programs/)使用 while 循环打印给定字符的金字塔模式。

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i = 1, j, k, rows;
    char ch;

    cout << "Enter Pyramid Star Pattern Row = ";
    cin >> rows;

    cout << "Enter Symbol for Pyramid Pattern = ";
    cin >> ch;

    cout << "Pyramid Star Pattern\n"; 

    while(i <= rows)
    {
        j = 0; 
    	while(j <= rows - i)
		{
            cout << " ";
            j++;
        }
        k = 0; 
        while(k < i * 2 - 1)
        {
            cout << ch;
            k++;
        }
        cout << "\n";
        i++;
    }		
 	return 0;
}
```

```cpp
Enter Pyramid Star Pattern Row = 18
Enter Symbol for Pyramid Pattern = $
Pyramid Star Pattern
                  $
