# 转到程序打印右帕斯卡星形三角形

> 原文：<https://www.tutorialgateway.org/go-program-to-print-right-pascals-star-triangle/>

编写一个 Go 程序，使用 for 循环打印右帕斯卡星形三角形。

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	var i, j, row int

	fmt.Print("Enter Right Pascals Star Pattern Rows = ")
	fmt.Scanln(&row)

	fmt.Println("Right Pascals Star Triangle Pattern")

	for i = 0; i < row; i++ {
		for j = 0; j <= i; j++ {
			fmt.Printf("* ")
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}

	for i = row - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		for j = 0; j <= i-1; j++ {
			fmt.Printf("* ")
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}
}
```

这个 [Go 示例](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/go-programs/)打印给定字符的右帕斯卡三角形图案。

```
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {

	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

	var i, j, row int

	fmt.Print("Enter Right Pascals Star Pattern Rows = ")
	fmt.Scanln(&row)

	fmt.Print("Character to Print in Right Pascals Triangle = ")
	ch, _, _ := reader.ReadRune()

	fmt.Println("Right Pascals Star Triangle Pattern")

	for i = 0; i < row; i++ {
		for j = 0; j <= i; j++ {
			fmt.Printf("%c ", ch)
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}

	for i = row - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		for j = 0; j <= i-1; j++ {
			fmt.Printf("%c ", ch)
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}
}
```

```
Enter Right Pascals Star Pattern Rows = 12
Character to Print in Right Pascals Triangle = @
